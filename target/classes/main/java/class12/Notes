Methods/Functions/Behaviours/routines
Methods are blocks of code that contains pre-written code that is executed when
we call methods.
Method is the smallest unit.
Static-lets the method be called on any class and package?
If class/method you want to call upon is in a different package. Simply write

import.packageName.className;

Two main types of methods;
1)Methods that do not return any data(void type)
2)Methods that can return data like int double char etc.
Syntax:
int add(int num1,int num2){
        int result=num1+num2;
        return result;
====================
datatype methodName(dateType nameOfParameter, datatype nameOfOtherParameter){
this is where we write the logic
}
int=>return type of method
add=>name of method
(int num1,int num2)=>Parameters
{Body of method
}


















We will go over String builder vs String

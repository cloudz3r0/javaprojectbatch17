Polymorphism:
Its the ability of an object to behave differently. We can achieve polymorphism in two ways
Overloading and overriding.

Why should we learn about polymorphism?
Cleaner code. We can use the same interface with different types of classes/objects.
Allows us to write dynamic programs. Not hard coding. Can save us from a lot of code repetition.
First we used inheritance. We use code from parent class into child and are able to use both parent and child classes.
Example:
WebDriver driver=new ChromeDriver();
ChromeDriver driver=new ChromeDriver();

Interview questions:
Do we need methodOverriding for polymorphism?
Yes but we can also use methodOverLoading.

Abstraction:
Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details
    and showing only the functionality (edited)
Why:
When we use abstraction it simplifies our code. Those classes which dont need to provide
the implementation to the methods can leave it. So now body for method.
keyword:
Abstract
Can we have private methods as abstract methods?
no private means no participation in inheritance. Which means no overriding which will
make abstract method useless
2) Can we have a method as final and abstract at the same time?
No bc final makes any element/method/variable unable to be overrided.
Makes it complete and does not require modification when abstract means incomplete and requires
modification.
Interfaces:
Interfaces are collection of public static final variables. By default they are public and abstract
After java 8 we can have default,static and private methods as well.
Why use?
1) There is no diamond problem which allows us to have multiple inheritance.
2)They are light weight simple contracts and can be used even when the classes are not
related to eachother.

Interview questions
Can we have private variables in a interface?
1) Private means no participation in inheritance which
        means no overriding which will make abstract method useless.
  2) Can we have a method as final and abstract at the same time?
        Final means something is complete and does not require any modification
        and abstract means something is incomplete and requires modification.
        These are opposite to each other and not allowed.

Encapsulation:
Irl definition. Inside the capsule. Create classes to write code and store data.
Use private access modifiers to secure the data by limiting access. Getter and setter methods.
Setter for update the value or overwrite data. Get method to get the field.
why should we learn about encapsulation?
It improves the control over the data that we store in the fields of a class.
Which leads us to more secure code.
Collections framework:
Contains a lot of classes and interfaces.
Which help us store and manipulate large amounts of data easily and efficiently
Why collections framework?
Arrays have limitations
1)They are fixed in size meaning once we provide the size we cant change it afterwards.
2)They dont have any built-in methods to help us process the data.

String class
A string class is designed to store symbols(letters(A,b,c), Numbers(10,25),
special characters (#,$,%) in the form of a group. There are many methods already written
by java developers that we can just use.
length()
startsWith()
endsWith()
contains()
charAt()

Method chaining:
when multiple methods are being called on the same line its called method chaining
String class supports method chaining. For method chaining to work previous method must return the
same expected datatype to the next method.
  String str="   Batch 17 IS GREAT.   ";
        System.out.println(str.toLowerCase().trim().replace("great","Good"));
System.out.println(str.lowerCase().isEmpty().replace("great,"Good") cant do this since isEmpty is a boolean


Note:
Very important coding questiond.
1)If else
2)Loops
3)Arrays
4)Strings
WHy we should learn:
Very important for coding questions
Most widley used class in all java
Most of the information in real life is present in the form of strings.

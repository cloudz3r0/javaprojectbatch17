What is Object Oriented programming (OOP)
Easier to write long codes especially ones that get repeated a lot. There are other ways
as well like functional programming.
Whenever you need a block of code and are too lazy to write it, can simply call it by its name or creating an object for it.
There are four main pillars of OOP
1)Inheritance: Help reduce amount of code that you might be writing again and again. Helps reuse code
2)Polymorphism: Many forms. Makes code dynamic. Makes code able to act differently depending on different situations.
3)Abstraction:
4)Encapsulation
Why we use OOP
1)Code re-usability
2)Its easier to write large amounts of code.
3)Sharing code with others becomes easier
4)Security of code is increased
5)Changing code becomes easier.
Objects:
An object is something that we can physically touch. Everything around us like chairs,tables,computers etc.
They are all objects. We can easily represent these objects inside our computers
by telling a computer how an object looks like and how it behaves.

Class:
A class is like a design/map/blueprint that we use to create objects.
String class:
A string class is used to store and manipulate text based data. Most of the information
inside computers is processed in this form. String is most widely used class in all Java.
Creating objects string class:
length() tells you how many letters/spaces there are in string
isEmpty()

operators
are symbols that perform an operation on data.
There are many different types of operators in java
Arithmetic:
Addition => + int a=10 int b=20 int c=a+b; => 30
subtraction => -
multiplication => *
division => /
Modulus => %
Shorthand operator:
add and update the variable += int a=10 a+=20 => 30
subtract and update the variable -= int a=10 a-=20 => -10
multiply and update the variable *= int a=10 a*=20 =200
divide and update the variable /= int a=10 a/=20 => 0
modulus and update the variable %= int a=10 a%=20 => 10
Relational Operators
== checks if two objects are equal
!= checks if two objects are not equal
<
>
>=
<=
Logical operators
They help us combine multiple boolean conditions
! not
&& AND
||OR
Increment/decrement operators
++help us increase the value of a variable by 1
--help us decrease the value of a variable by 1

Sets:
Sets are a special set of classes which do not allow duplicate elements.
Set is the main interface and there are three main classes which implement
this interface. HashSet,LinkedHashset,TreeSet.
Hashset:
UpSide:Its fastest of all.
down:Does not remember insertion order.

LinkedHashSet:
Upsides:Maintains insertion order
DownSides:A little slower than hashset but preferable

TreeSet:
Upside:Keeps the data in sorted form
downside:Very slow since it sorts everything behind the scenes.

Maps:
  Map is an interface that allows us to store key value pairs.

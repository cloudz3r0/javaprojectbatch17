HashMaps:
Maps are data structures which stores key value pairs
There are many different types of maps in java but we will be discussing
1)Hashmap 2)LinkedHashMap. 3)TreeMap. 4)HashTable.
Maps are not part of the collections framework. Map is the name of the interface and al theses maps
are classes that implemented the map interface.
Why we should learn about maps?
Able to hold key pairs instead of one value. All the other datastructures that we have learned can only
store one value at a time. Makes a better choice because we know what we are storing.
Syntax:
NameOfTheClass <DataType> variableName=new NameOfTheCLass<>();
ArrayList<String> names=-new ArrayList();
In the values we can store objects of our own classes if we want.

Constructors:
Help us build objects from classes easily. Constructors are public 99% of time.
90% methods are public, 8% private and rest of the time they are default or protected.
Constructors are used to initialize objects during creation and methods
perform specific actions or calculations. Constructor must have same name
as class.
Helps us build objects from classes easily. Help give us initial values to the instance fields.

Import static methods to other packages.
Public static before method.

If exactly the same java will get an error.

When we do not create any constructor java automatically creates a default constructor behind the scenes

File?
Files are something that we use to store information. Saves anything.
1)For example txt files are used to store raw text.
2)pdf files are usually used to store books and articles.
3)xls files are usually used to store information  in the form of a table.
4).jpg . jpeg .png are used to store images
5).mp4 .mkv are used to store videos.

Why we use?
Its easier to move the information around because it just one single file

Folders/Directories:
Its like a container for files. It can contain many different files. We use it to organize information.

File Handling:
File handling is the process of creating/editing/accessing/deleting the
files on a computer with the help of a programming language.


Steps to work with file:
1)To locate the file usually we use the absolute paths to locate.
ex:"C:/users/syntax/desktop/batch17/names.txt"
2)We need to have access and a piece of software that can edit/open that file.
3)To bring files from permanent storage into ram to start working with it.

What is RAM?
Temporary storage. Its very fast but very expensive and does not store data permanently.
Once we turn off the computer everything that we put in the ram is gone.

What is HDD/SSD/NVME/Storage:
Its the permanent storage that we use to store things its cheap but slow.

Why should we learn about FileHandling?
1) So that we can store the data permanent
2) We can store the sensitive data like userNames passwords etc inside the files and keep them secure on our
computers and dont push it with code on github.
3) All the configuration related information like URLS and types of testing will also be stored
in the files.

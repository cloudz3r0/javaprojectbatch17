Types of variables:
There are three types of variables. Local, Instance, and Static.
Local variables:
Local variables are the variables which are created. Declared inside a block of code.
Like if else conditions, loop, switch statements, methods are block of code

Upside:
They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. As soon as
java executes that block of code it gets removed.


downside: can only be accessed in the block of code they are created in.

 Instance variables:
 Instance variables are the variables which are created outside
 of the blocks(if else conditions, loop, switch statements, methods) of
 code but inside a class.
 Upside:
 Can be used anywhere within that class.
 Downside:
 They are created when an object of the class is created and they will stay in
 the memory as long as that object is in the memory whether you use them or not.

 Local vs Instance:
 Whenever it is possible go and create local variables.

 Static variables:
 Static variables are created inside a class but outside of a block of code.
 Upside:
 They are universal when it comes to scope and accessibility.
 We dont need to create the object of that class to access it.
 Downside:
 Static variables occupy the memory for longest of all.
 They are created even though you dont create an object of the
 class.

 Show example of objects and methods using selenium.

Uses of types of local variables:
Local:
When ever we are solving any problems many times we need local variables
to temporarily store data. In all of those cases you should be going with
local variables.



Note:
we will do a little bit of String Builder
We will discuss thread safety StringBuilder vs String buffer
one example for methods as well

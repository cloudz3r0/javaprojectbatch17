Constructors help us create the objects from the classes in a more secure
and neat way. We can also put any piece of code that we want to execute
when the object of a class is created.
Why we should use?
1)help us write more secure classes
2)Cleaner code
3)More control over the values that we can assign to the instance fields.
Syntax:
1)No return not even void
2)Same name as class name
3)Usually public access modifier.

SuperKeyword:
Helps us refer to parent class.
To call something from parent class Specifically.
Why should we use super?
1)It is used to specifically call something from parent class.
Cant call private members. Use this keyword to call on parents private instance.
2)We can user super(); to call the constructor from the parent.

MethodOverloading:
1)When we have same method with different parameters its called method overloading.
2)3 ways to overload. Change the count of parameters. Change the order of parameters.
Change the datatypes. we can overload methods and constructors.
Why?
No need for different name methods if they just need parameters.
Cleaner code. Reuse same name.
interview questions?

===========================================================
Method Overriding:
When same method is present in parent as well as child class. Its called method overriding.
